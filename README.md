# Mini WiFi Firmware

An alternative firmware for ESP8266 devices that uses a custom binary protocol for communications.

The binary protocol allows for smaller client libraries that don't require string parsing, like when using the default AT firmware.

# Usage

Please check the main loop or the Arduino client library (see Related section).
